### ElasticSearch
Please use the CompletionLoader class and give the location of your actors file to its main method.
As it is CPU heavy import process may take several minutes

### Neo4J
To import actors and movies data into Neo4J, please use the following command :

```
bin/neo4j-import --nodes:Movie movies.csv --nodes:Actor actors.csv --relationships roles.csv --into <your neo4j database path>
```

We also added an index on :Actor
